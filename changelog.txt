0.2.0
Nexela remade almost the entire mod from the ground up, now is dynamic in finding and adding recipes. 
Only static thing is the auto-compressor which is a dynamic machine with graphics by Arch666Angel and actual animations. 
All mods should have recipes dynamically generated for compression/decompression. 
Now any assembling machine can make a compressed/decompressed recipe.
auto-compressor is a lower level item that only uses compressor recipes can both compress and decompress.
auto-compressor auto selects recipes and is about twice as fast as an assembling machine lvl.3 at compression recipes
recipe cost in assembler based on how big original stack size is.
